# Getting started with Git and Python

## Starting
1. Download GIT tools from https://git-scm.com/downloads
2. Pull from this git by typing in the command line
<pre><code>git clone https://github.com/cjho83/kaband</code></pre>
3. Open up main_nitf.py and try to run it.

## Next TBD
Ask me when you're done with doing this.
